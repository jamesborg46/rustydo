Hereâ€™s a set of specifications for a lightweight command-line "to-do" application. These specifications are ideal for a small learning project in Rust, incorporating common features while keeping complexity manageable:

---

### **Project Name:** `RustyDo`

### **Specifications**

#### 1. **Core Features**
   - **Add Task**: Allow users to add a new task to their to-do list with a description and optional due date.
     - Example: `rustydo add "Buy groceries" --due 2024-12-01`
   - **List Tasks**: Display all tasks with optional filters (e.g., by status or due date).
     - Example: `rustydo list --status pending --due 2024-12-01`
   - **Mark as Done**: Mark a task as completed using its ID.
     - Example: `rustydo done 1`
   - **Delete Task**: Remove a task by its ID.
     - Example: `rustydo delete 1`
   - **Clear Completed**: Remove all tasks marked as done.
     - Example: `rustydo clear`

#### 2. **Data Management**
   - Store tasks persistently using a lightweight format such as **JSON** or **TOML**.
   - Tasks should include the following fields:
     - ID (auto-incremented)
     - Description
     - Status (`Pending` or `Done`)
     - Due Date (optional)
     - Timestamp of creation

#### 3. **User Interface**
   - Simple, text-based CLI interface.
   - Use **ANSI colors** for readability:
     - Pending tasks in white.
     - Completed tasks in green.
     - Overdue tasks in red.
   - Provide concise output by default and verbose output with a flag (e.g., `--verbose`).

#### 4. **CLI Arguments and Flags**
   - Use a library like **clap** or **structopt** for argument parsing.
   - Support the following commands:
     - `add`: Add a task.
     - `list`: List tasks with optional filters.
     - `done`: Mark a task as done.
     - `delete`: Delete a task.
     - `clear`: Clear all completed tasks.
     - `help`: Display usage information.
   - Support global flags for user experience:
     - `--verbose`: Detailed output.
     - `--version`: Display app version.
     - `--help`: Display help.

#### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Provide meaningful error messages for:
     - Invalid input (e.g., missing arguments or invalid dates).
     - Non-existent task IDs.
   - Gracefully handle file read/write errors.

#### 6. **Performance**
   - Ensure the program is responsive and can handle at least 1000 tasks efficiently.
   - Minimize file reads/writes by caching data in memory while the application is running.

#### 7. **Extensibility**
   - Design the codebase for future enhancements:
     - Adding priorities (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`).
     - Supporting recurring tasks.
     - Syncing with external services.

#### 8. **Documentation**
   - Include a `README.md` with:
     - Installation instructions.
     - Usage examples.
     - Contribution guidelines.
   - Inline code comments for maintainability.

#### 9. **Testing**
   - Include unit tests for core functionality (e.g., adding tasks, marking them as done).
   - Include integration tests to ensure CLI commands work as expected.

#### 10. **Stretch Goals (Optional)**
   - **Search Feature**: Allow searching tasks by keyword.
     - Example: `rustydo search "groceries"`
   - **Task Prioritization**: Add priority levels to tasks.
   - **Export/Import**: Allow users to export/import tasks as a file.
   - **Interactive Mode**: Include an interactive mode for users who prefer navigation over commands.
